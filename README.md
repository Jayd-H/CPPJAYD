# CPPJAYD

Made this in an hour or so because I wanted to and I grew tired of using visual studio for C++ because of how clunky and bloated it can be. Very basic as it stands. Creates a new C++ project and copies over the existing launch.json and tasks.json files. This is really only for me so I will update it as I develop my C++ skills.

### Usage

To use you need to have the GCC/G++ compiler installed, with it in your system PATH, along with this script.

```
$ jaydcpp [64/32] [projectname]
```

Executing this command will generate a new project directory and open it in Visual Studio Code.
